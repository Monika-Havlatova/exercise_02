# Introduction to (R and) R/Bioconductor and Regular Expressions

## Introduction to (R and) R/Bioconductor
### Task 1
* Load the DNA sequence `fishes.fna.gz` using functions from the `seqinr` package and the `Biostrings` package.
Note the differences between the created variables.

### Task 2
* Next, focus on the `Biostrings` package. Practice working with loaded data:
    * Check the number of loaded sequences:
        ```R
        length(seq)
        ```
    * Determine the lengths of each sequence:
        ```R
        width(seq[1])
        ```
    * View the sequence names (FASTA headers):
        ```R
        names(seq)
        ```
    * Assign the first sequence including the name to the variable `seq1`:
        ```R
        seq1 <- seq[1]
        ```
    * Assign the first sequence without the name to the variable `seq1_sequence`:
        ```R
        seq1_sequence <- seq[[1]]
        ```
    * Assign the first sequence as a vector of characters to the variable `seq1_string`:
        ```R
        seq1_string <- toString(seq[1])
        ```
    * Learn more about the `XStringSet` class and the `Biostrings` package:
        ```R
        help(XStringSet)
        ```

### Task 3
 * Translate and globally align the two selected sequences using the BLOSUM62 matrix, a gap opening cost of -1 and a gap extension cost of 1.

## Regular Expressions
### Task 4
* Practice working with regular expressions:
    * Create a list of names, e.g.:
        ```R
        names_list <- c("anna", "jana", "kamil", "norbert", "pavel", "petr", "stanislav", "zuzana")
        ```
    * Search for name `jana`:
        ```R
        grep("jana", names_list, perl = TRUE)
        ```
    * Search for all names containing letter `n` at least once:
        ```R
        grep("n+", names_list, perl = TRUE)
        ```
    * Search for all names containing letters `nn`:
        ```R
        grep("n{2}", names_list, perl = TRUE)
        ```
    * Search for all names starting with `n`:
        ```R
        grep("^n", names_list, perl = TRUE)
        ```
    * Search for names `Anna` or `Jana`:
        ```R
        grep("Anna|Jana", names_list, perl = TRUE)
        ```
    * Search for names starting with `z` and ending with `a`:
        ```R
        grep("^z.*a$", names_list, perl = TRUE)
        ```

### Task 5
* Load an amplicon sequencing run from 454 Junior machine `fishes.fna.gz`.
* Get a sequence of a sample (avoid conditional statements), that is tagged by forward and reverse MID `ACGAGTGCGT`.
* How many sequences are there in the sample?

### Task 6
* Create a function `Demultiplexer()` for demultiplexing of sequencing data.

* Input:
    * a string with path to fasta file
    * a list of forward MIDs
    * a list of reverse MIDs
    * a list of samples labels

* Output:
    * fasta files that are named after the samples and contain sequences of the sample without MIDs (perform MID trimming)
    * table named `report.txt` containing samplesâ€˜ names and  the number of sequences each sample has

* Check the functionality again on the `fishes.fna.gz` file, the list of samples and MIDs can be found in the corresponding table `fishes_MIDs.csv`.
